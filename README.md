# PROJECT-ON-HIRING-PROCESS-ANALYTICS
The hiring process is a crucial function of any company, and understanding trends such as the number of rejections, interviews, job types, and vacancies can provide valuable insights for the hiring department. 
Here comes the role of a Data Analyst to analyze the company's hiring process data and draw meaningful insights from it.


A dataset containing records of previous hires is provided to the Data Analyst, and their job is to analyze this data and answer specific questions that can help the company improve its hiring process.


This project aims to use our knowledge of statistics and Excel to draw meaningful conclusions about the company's hiring process and get insights that could help the company improve its hiring process and make better hiring decisions.
Here, we will be doing the job of a Data Analyst to understand how the hiring process analytics is done at big Multi National Companies like Google.



Our primary work is to clean data by following steps like:


Handling Missing Data: Check for any missing values in the dataset. If there are, decide on the best strategy to manage them.
Clubbing Columns: If columns with multiple categories can be combined, do so to simplify your analysis.
Outlier Detection: Check for outliers in the dataset that may skew your analysis.
Removing Outliers: Decide on the best strategy to handle outliers. This could be removing them, replacing them, or leaving them as is, depending on the situation.
Data Summary: After cleaning and preparing your data, summarize the findings. This could involve calculating averages, medians, or other statistical measures. It could also include creating visualizations to understand the data better.


Data Analytics Tasks:

From the given dataset we will find answers to the questions below using Excel:
A. Hiring Analysis: The hiring process involves bringing new individuals into the organization for various roles.
Task: Determine the gender distribution of hires. How many males and females have been hired by the company?
B. Salary Analysis: The average salary is calculated by adding up the salaries of a group of employees and then dividing the total by the number of employees.
Task: What is the average salary offered by this company? Use Excel functions to calculate this.
C. Salary Distribution: Class intervals represent ranges of values, in this case, salary ranges. The class interval is the difference between the upper and lower limits of a class.
Task: Create class intervals for the salaries in the company. This will help you understand the salary distribution.
D. Departmental Analysis: Visualizing data through charts and plots is a crucial part of data analysis.
Task: Use a pie chart, bar graph, or any other suitable visualization to show the proportion of people working in different departments.
E. Position Tier Analysis: Different positions within a company often have different tiers or levels.
Task: Use a chart or graph to represent the different position tiers within the company. This will help you understand the distribution of positions across different tiers.
